    "overview": "Description\nRunning a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first impressions appear. There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping up that could hurt business.\n\nOne common predicament is that restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members. This forecast isn't easy to make because many unpredictable factors affect restaurant attendance, like weather and local competition. It's even harder for newer restaurants with little historical data.\n\nRecruit Holdings has unique access to key datasets that could make automated future customer prediction possible. Specifically, Recruit Holdings owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).\n\nIn this competition, you're challenged to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.\n\nEvaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the root mean squared logarithmic error.\n\nThe RMSLE is calculated as\n\nsqrt((1/n) * sum_{i=1}^n (log(p_i + 1) - log(a_i + 1))^2),\n\nwhere:\n\n\\\\(n\\\\) is the total number of observations\n\\\\(p_i\\\\) is your prediction of visitors\n\\\\(a_i\\\\) is the actual number of visitors\n\\\\(\\log(x)\\\\) is the natural logarithm of \\\\(x\\\\)\n\n",
