    "🚀 Introduction 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello Kaggle Enthusiasts! 🧠💡\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vast world of machine learning, most of us are familiar with the usual suspects: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a variety of neural networks like LSTM. However, this notebook is about to take a different turn. 🔄 We're diving into the world of Support Vector Regressions (SVR). 🌐\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 What is SVR? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR, a member of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) family, is essentially a regression method. In simple terms, while classic SVM is used for classification problems, SVR is used for regression problems. Imagine SVM as a clever algorithm that finds the best line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to separate two classes. SVR, on the other hand, uses a similar approach to fit the best line within a predefined error threshold for a set of data points. This makes it particularly useful in forecasting and predicting continuous values. 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "What sets SVR apart is its ability to manage non-linear relationships by employing kernels. I will argue that a well implemented SVR with RBF kernel can compete with gradient boosting tools any day!. Kernels transform the data into a higher dimension where it's possible to find a linear separation (or closest to it). 🌐⚙️\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 SVR vs. SVC: The Connection and Difference 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "While SVR focuses on regression, its cousin, Support Vector Classification (SVC), deals with classification tasks. Both share the same foundation of maximizing margin and minimizing classification/regression error, but they differ in their ultimate goals. SVC aims to find the best separating hyperplane to classify data points, whereas SVR tries to fit the best line within a certain tolerance to the data points. Despite these differences, their underlying principles and mathematics are closely related. 🤝\n",
    "\n",
    "⏱️ The SVR Calibration Challenge ⏱️\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical point to note about SVR is its calibration time. SVR can be slow to tune and calibrate due to its complexity, especially when dealing with large datasets. Hence, it's a wise strategy to perform this calibration step ahead of time and save the calibrated model for future use. 🔄💾\n",
    "\n",
    "📚 This Notebook's Journey 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we begin by guiding you through the offline installation of RAPIDS, an open-source suite of libraries for executing end-to-end data science pipelines entirely on GPUs, which significantly speeds up the data science process. 🚀 I run the installation with the help of a supporting notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/verracodeguacas/rapids-installer feel free to use that notebook to learn how to install stuff offline for this and other kaggle competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we delve into training the SVR model. Although I've commented out the actual training code, it's there for you to experiment with and calibrate your models. The calibration can be time-consuming, so I've provided a link to a pre-trained SVR model: SVR Models Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/verracodeguacas/svr-models. 📈💻\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll explore how to use this trained SVR model for predictions and demonstrate how to ensemble it with other popular models like LightGBM. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of different models for better performance. 🤖💥\n",
    "\n",
    "Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of SVR, a less-traveled path with promising potential in machine learning! 🌟🛤️"
